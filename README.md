## Description
This repository contains the data and code required to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

[Bianconi, F.](www.bianconif.net), Conti, P., [Zanetti, E.M.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabetta-zanetti-0a183626/), [Pascoletti, G.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giulia-pascoletti-273b2618a/) __A benchmark of traditional visual descriptors and convolutional networks 'off-the-shelf' for anomaly detection__, accepted for oral presentation at the International Joint Conference on Mechanics, Design Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing ([JCM 2022](https://www.associazioneadm.it/jcm2022/index.php), June 01-03, 2022 - Ischia, Italy)

## Usage
1. Execute the `experiments.py` script
2. Retrieve the results in LaTeX tabular form in the `output/LaTeX` folder

## Dependencies
- [CenOTAPH v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/bianconif/CenOTAPH)
- [Numpy 1.19.1](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas 1.0.5](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
